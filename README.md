A small, but growing collection of animated spells for use with various VTT's in the top-down/overhead perspective. All files are in transparent webm format. Files will be located in your "Data\modules\animated-spell-effects\spell-effects" folder. If you like my work, consider saying thanks on Discord: jackkerouac#0624.
